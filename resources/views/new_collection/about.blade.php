                                        <p>Welcome to The Clarkin Collection and thank you for taking a look  through my last eight years of exploration and landscape photography.  The question is often asked, where the desire to get involved in  landscape photography emanated from. I can say it didn't, initially,  arise out of an ambition for photography itself, but rather a desire to  share and communicate my adventures through the spiritually evocative  scenes Mother Nature afforded me, along my photographic journeys.</p>

                        <p>Growing up, I spent a great deal of time in the mountains and lakes, of  the Adirondacks, in upstate New York and while New York City is one of  the most beautiful cities, in many respects, those unfamiliar with the  rest of the state wouldn’t realize the spectacular settings the  Adirondacks and upper regions of New York have to offer. This, along  with a true sense for adventure, likely spurred the passion for  capturing such incredible scenery. While it’s hard to say when the real  intererst in landscape photography began, a high school trip across  Europe visiting many of the major historical landmarks only yielding,  roughly, 100 images of the Swiss Alps, was likely a good indicator. I'll  never forget the look on my Father's face as he quickly sifted through  so many pictures, with almost no variation from one to the next.  Apparently, I failed to realize that once you've seen two or three  glacier shots, the other 97 don't exactly come across as unique.</p>
                        <p>While some shots were destination shots and involved serious hikes and  tremendous patience, others like Aspen Glory were simply and fortunately  a result of being in the right place at the right time. That said, in  most instances, I'd spend 4 to 7 days at a location waiting for the  optimal weather conditions to offer up the extraordinary light we all  chase, in hopes of capturing that perfect shot. I’ll often look back at  photos taken in earlier years, of Europe, the Swiss Alps, Bali Indonesia  and some of the most beautiful places in the world and regret not  having the appropriate equipment to capture these places in the way they  deserved. The good news is, they can always be re-visited and many  locations require multiple visits before feeling you've even captured  the appropriate shot. Additionally, with all the amazing places I’ve had  the fortune to explore, I’ve found the majestic and iconic landscapes  of the Western U.S., Hawaii and Canadian Rockies to be virtually  unparalleled. The landscape diversity you find in these regions is truly  unlike anywhere in the world and while Upstate New York offers some  magnificent landscapes, of it's own, it wasn’t until a move out west  that the true inspiration for capturing such compelling imagery evolved.</p>
